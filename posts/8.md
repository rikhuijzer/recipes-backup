# Gingerbread Cookies

## Ingredients

1. 250 g wheat or spelt flour or a gluten-free flour mix
1. 1 teaspoon baking soda or 2 teaspoon baking powder
1. ¼ teaspoon salt
1. 2 teaspoon ground ginger
1. 2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1. ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
1. 45 g vegan butter, room temperature
1. 100 g coconut sugar or brown sugar
1. 80 g molasses or sugar beet syrup
1. 1 flaxseed egg (see instructions) or 4 tablespoon applesauce

## Instructions

1. Prepare Flaxseed Egg: In a small cup, mix 1 tablespoon ground flaxseeds (or chia seeds) with 3 tbsp hot water. Let it sit for 5 minutes.
1. Mix Dry Ingredients: Combine flour, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl.
1. Cream Butter and Sugar: In another bowl, cream the room temperature vegan butter and coconut sugar together.
1. Add Molasses and Egg Substitute: Mix in the molasses and prepared flaxseed egg (or applesauce) until well combined.
1. Combine with Flour Mixture: Gradually add the flour mixture, stirring with a wooden spoon until a sticky dough forms. (If the dough is too sticky, add a bit more flour).
1. Divide and Chill Dough: Divide the dough into two portions, shape each into a flat ball, wrap tightly in foil, and refrigerate for at least one hour.
1. Preheat Oven and Roll Dough: After chilling, preheat the oven to 175°C (350°F). Generously flour a work surface. Roll out the dough to about 0.5 cm thickness using a lightly floured rolling pin.
1. Cut Out Cookies: Dip a cookie cutter in flour and cut out cookies. Carefully transfer them to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving about 5 cm space between each cookie.
1. Bake: Repeat the rolling and cutting process with the remaining dough. Bake the cookies for 8-10 minutes or until they are crispy and lightly browned on the edges.
1. Cool: Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes (they will firm up during this time). Then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
1. Serve: Dust with powdered sugar or decorate as desired before serving.
