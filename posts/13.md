# Pancakes

## Ingredients

For 4 medium (15 cm diameter) pancakes:

- 160g all-purpose **flour**
- 1 teaspoon of **baking powder**
- 1 pinch of **salt**
- 1 tablespoon **cinnamon** or **vanilla extract**
- 200 ml **plantmilk**
- 1-2 tablespoons **maple syrup** or **sugar** to taste
- 1-2 tablespoons **oil** for baking

## Instructions

1. Combine flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon in a bowl.
    (The more baking powder, the fluffier and stronger the pancakes will be.
    American pancakes are usually made with more baking powder than European pancakes.
    The current recipe is more European.)
1. Add plant milk and maple syrup and stir until just combined.
1. Heat some oil in a large pan over medium heat.
   Can be a non-stick or a stainless steel pan. \
   For both pans and especially the stainless steel pan, ensure that the pan is hot enough before backing. \
   (On an electric stove, level 4-5 on a 9 level scale should be sufficient.)
1. Add a bit of oil to the pan per pancake and bake from both sides.
   Generally, thinner pancakes are more tasty with this recipe.
